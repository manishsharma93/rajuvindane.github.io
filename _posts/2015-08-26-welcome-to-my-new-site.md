I know stuff, which I think can be very useful to others, in order to share this stuff I have been using [Wordpress](wordpress.com)
and [Blogger](blogspot.com) to create blog posts in the past. And it all had too
much stuff to focus on and to maintain. Including which theme to choose, what
font to choose for texts and images and stuff that confused up the Blogger.
Also the rendering of many of these sites on was not appropriate on small display
screens of phones and tablets.

I was sailing through the web and I came across an interesting blog post
[Blogging like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)
And here I discovered [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and it sparked my interest.

Based on my discoveries, here is my new site based on Jekyll and hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
The coolest part about this site is that It is managed using [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/)

My site is based on [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com) a theme created with
<3 by [johnotander](http://johnotander.com). Thanks to his efforts, this site looks amazing,
emphasizes content rather than aesthetic stuff. Itâ€™s mobile first, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

A blog post on _How to setup your own site based on Github Pages?_ will be coming up soon.
