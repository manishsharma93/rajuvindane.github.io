I know a lot of technical and non-technical stuff, which I think can be very useful to make others life easier, in order to share this stuff I have used [Wordpress](wordpress.com) and [Blogger](blogspot.com) to create blog posts.
And it all had too much stuff to focus on and to maintain. Including which theme to choose, what style for texts and images and stuff that confused up the Blogger.

And recently I discovered [Jekyll](jekyllrb.com) and it sparked my interest.
I was surfing the web and I came to an interesting blog post [Blogging like a Hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html)

So this is my new site here based on Jekyll and hosted using [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
The coolest part about this site is that It is managed using [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/)

The theme for my site is based on [Pixyll](http://pixyll.com) a theme created with
<3 by [johnotander](http://johnotander.com). Thanks to his efforts, this site looks amazing,
mphasizes content rather than aesthetic fluff.Itâ€™s mobile first, fluidly responsive, and delightfully lightweight.

A blog post on _How to setup your own site based on Github Pages?_ will be coming soon.
